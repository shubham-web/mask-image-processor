# Not So Automatic Background Removal Tool

The Background Removal Tool is a web application that allows users to remove backgrounds from images using a mask and an input image. It's a simple tool that helps you create transparent backgrounds for your images.

## How It Works

1. Upload a black and white mask image, where black represents the background and white marks the object.
2. Upload your image with the object you want to keep in focus.
3. Watch as the tool removes the background, leaving only the object against a transparent background.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or visit https://mask-image-processor.vercel.app/ and move to step 3.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Upload your mask image (black and white) and your input image.
4. See the magic happen as the tool removes the background!

## Purpose

I just found a (not really) free public api that could generate me a mask for any image saperating object and background as black n white mask and needed something to blend it up. So I ended up making this.
